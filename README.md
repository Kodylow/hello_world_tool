# hello_world_tool: A Simple Web Server with Axum

This repository contains a simple web server implemented using the Axum framework, designed to serve a basic "Hello, World!" response. It is intended for use by agents who require a straightforward example of an Axum server setup that they can add endpoints to.

## Overview

The server is set up to listen on port `3000` and responds with "Hello, World!" to any requests to the root URL (`/`). This example is particularly useful for understanding the basics of setting up an HTTP server with Axum and handling simple get requests.

## Requirements

- Rust Programming Language
- Cargo (Rust's package manager and build system)

## Running the Server

To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine
3. Run `cargo run` in the project directory
